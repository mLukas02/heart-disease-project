### Heart Disease Project

This project uses [Heart Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset) dataset.


## Usage
This package allows you to train model for detecting the presence of heart disease in the patient.
1. Create project with poetry
2. Download [Heart Disease ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset) dataset, save csv locally (default path is *data/heart.csv* in repository's root).
3. Make sure Python 3.8 (or higher) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) are installed on your machine (I use Poetry 1.1.13).
4. Install project dependencies. You should run this terminal command in a root of repository:
```sh 
poetry install --no-dev
```
